# question
Briefly (in no more than 250 words), explain an application where we have a situation that does not require input documents to be valid (for example against a RelaxNG schema, etc.) but instead merely well-formed. Explain as well how a (RelaxNG) schema might still be useful in this situation.   Marking: as always, make sure that your writing is clear and to the point, and free of typos or grammatical errors - and that you answer the question!
