# question
A conceptual model has no direct, visible, or usable counterpart in a database. Given this fact, discuss whether it is ever worth having one and thus spending effort on producing one. 

# my opinion
It is necessary to have a conceptual model in the process of database design. Using conceptual models to capture the related counterpart in a data base is not its original purpose. Instead, with the help of conceptual model, we can understand the basic principles and functions of the system. Conceptual modeling a key task for experts to develop a medium which stands for the elements of real world during the whole system design process (Wand and Weber, 2002). In addition, the correct implementation of a conceptual model will produce the following results (Kung and Solvberg, 1986):
1. Enhance personal understanding of the database to be designed.
2. enable stakeholders to communicate system details more intuitively.
3. Provide references for system designers to select system standards.
4. Support documentation for future system design and collaboration. 

Mendling et al. (2018) designed an experiment and find that conceptual modeling literature would benefit from a more developed understanding of which MVCs need to be included in experimental designs. This also reflects that conceptual models can help people understand the design of experiments.
Obviously, the conceptual models play an important role in the whole system design process. Without conceptual models, many serious problems will arise in the process of system design, such as changing demands, incomplete functions and logical contradiction.
