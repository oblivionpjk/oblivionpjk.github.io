# question
A conceptual model has no direct, visible, or usable counterpart in a database. Given this fact, discuss whether it is ever worth having one and thus spending effort on producing one. 

# my opinion
It is necessary to have a conceptual model in the process of database design. Using conceptual models to capture the related counterpart in a data base is not its original purpose. Instead, with the help of conceptual model, we can understand the basic principles and functions of the system. In addition, the correct implementation of a conceptual model will produce the following resulits:
1. Enhance personal understanding of the database to be designed.
2. enable stakeholders to communicate system details more intuitively.
3. Provide references for system designers to select system standards.
4. Support documentation for future system design and collaboration. 

Obviously, the conceptual models play an important role in the whole system design process. Without conceptual models, many serious problems will arise in the process of system design, such as changing demands, incomplete functions and logical contradiction.
